# Taxi-price-prediction-model
This model is used to predict taxi trip price based on various factors such as distance ,weather, base fares, and duration in minutes. It provides realistic synthetic predictions for regression tasks, offering a unique opportunity to explore pricing trends in the taxi industry.

## Dataset Description
This dataset is designed to predict taxi trip fares based on various factors such as distance,traffic conditions, weather, base fares and trip duration in minutes. It provides realistic synthetic data for regression tasks, offering a unique opportunity to explore pricing trends in the taxi industry.

Traffic conditions is been converted from categorical to quantitative variables were:
- Low = 1
- Medium = 2
- High = 3

Weather also:
- Clear = 1
- rain = 2
- snow = 3

## Key Features
•	Distance (in kilometers): The length of the trip.
•	Pickup Time: The starting time of the trip.
•	Dropoff Time: The ending time of the trip.
•	Traffic Condition: Categorical indicator of traffic (light, medium, heavy).
•	Passenger Count: Number of passengers for the trip.
•	Weather Condition: Categorical data for weather (clear, rain, snow).
•	Trip Duration (in minutes): Total trip time.
•	Fare Amount (target): The cost of the trip (in USD).

## Dataset Highlights
•	1,000+ rows of data, ensuring a robust sample for model training.
•	Includes missing values and outliers for realistic preprocessing challenges.
•	Introduces correlations among some features to simulate real-world scenarios.
•	Suitable for regression analysis and feature engineering exercises.
